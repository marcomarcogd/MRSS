# XPath Mode for MRSS

MRSS supports XPath mode for extracting RSS-like content from websites that don't provide standard RSS/Atom feeds. This mode allows you to define XPath expressions to scrape article data directly from HTML or XML pages.

## How It Works

1. When adding a new feed, select "XPath" as the feed type
2. Choose between "HTML + XPath" or "XML + XPath" depending on your source
3. Provide the source URL and configure XPath expressions for different article elements
4. MRSS will parse the page and extract articles using your XPath expressions

## XPath Types

### HTML + XPath

Use this for regular web pages. The HTML will be parsed and cleaned before applying XPath expressions.

### XML + XPath

Use this for XML-based sources that aren't standard RSS/Atom feeds.

## Required Configuration

### Source URL

The URL of the webpage or XML document to scrape.

### Item XPath (Required)

The XPath expression that selects all article containers on the page. This is the most important expression as it defines what constitutes an "article".

**Example:** `//div[contains(@class, "post")]` - selects all div elements with class containing "post"

## Optional XPath Expressions

### Title XPath

XPath expression to extract the article title, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//h1[contains(@class, "title")]` - finds h1 elements with "title" in class within each article

### URL XPath

XPath expression to extract the article URL/link, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//a[contains(@class, "link")]/@href` - extracts the href attribute of anchor tags

### Content XPath

XPath expression to extract the article content/summary, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//div[contains(@class, "content")]` - selects content divs within each article

### Author XPath

XPath expression to extract the article author, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//span[contains(@class, "author")]` - selects author spans within each article

### Timestamp XPath

XPath expression to extract the publication date/time, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//time/@datetime` - extracts datetime attributes from time elements

### Time Format

The format of the timestamp extracted above. Uses Go time format layout.

**Common formats:**

- `2006-01-02 15:04:05` - RFC3339-like format
- `Mon, 02 Jan 2006 15:04:05 -0700` - RFC1123 format
- `2006-01-02T15:04:05Z` - ISO 8601 format

### Thumbnail XPath

XPath expression to extract article thumbnail images, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//img/@src` - extracts src attributes from img elements

### Categories XPath

XPath expression to extract article categories/tags, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//span[contains(@class, "tag")]` - selects tag spans within each article

### UID XPath

XPath expression to extract a unique identifier for each article, relative to each item.

**Example:** `.//article/@id` - extracts id attributes from article elements

## XPath Basics

XPath is a language for selecting nodes in XML/HTML documents. Here are some common patterns:

### Basic Selectors

- `//div` - Select all div elements anywhere in the document
- `/html/body/div` - Select div elements that are direct children of body
- `.//p` - Select all p elements within the current context (relative path)

### Attribute Selection

- `//a/@href` - Select href attributes of all links
- `//img/@src` - Select src attributes of all images
- `//div[@class="post"]` - Select divs with exact class "post"

### Class-Based Selection

- `//div[contains(@class, "post")]` - Select divs where class contains "post"
- `//div[@class="post" or @class="article"]` - Select divs with either class

### Text Content

- `//h1/text()` - Get text content of h1 elements
- `//div[@class="content"]//text()` - Get all text within content divs

### Position-Based Selection

- `//div[@class="post"][1]` - Select first post div
- `//div[@class="post"][position() <= 5]` - Select first 5 post divs

## Examples

### Blog with Article Cards

For a blog where articles are in divs with class "article-card":

- **Item XPath:** `//div[contains(@class, "article-card")]`
- **Title XPath:** `.//h2/a/text()`
- **URL XPath:** `.//h2/a/@href`
- **Content XPath:** `.//div[contains(@class, "excerpt")]`
- **Author XPath:** `.//span[contains(@class, "author")]/text()`
- **Timestamp XPath:** `.//time/@datetime`
- **Time Format:** `2006-01-02`

### News Site with Article List

For a news site with articles in li elements:

- **Item XPath:** `//ul[@class="news-list"]/li`
- **Title XPath:** `.//h3/a/text()`
- **URL XPath:** `.//h3/a/@href`
- **Content XPath:** `.//p[@class="summary"]/text()`
- **Timestamp XPath:** `.//span[@class="date"]/text()`
- **Time Format:** `Jan 2, 2006`

## Testing XPath Expressions

To test your XPath expressions:

1. Open the target webpage in a browser
2. Use browser developer tools (F12)
3. In the Console, you can test XPath with: `$x("//your/xpath/here")`
4. Adjust expressions until they select the desired elements

## Troubleshooting

### No Articles Found

- Check that your Item XPath is correct and matches article containers
- Verify the source URL is accessible
- Ensure the page structure hasn't changed

### Wrong Content Extracted

- Double-check your XPath expressions are relative (start with `.//`)
- Test expressions individually in browser dev tools
- Make sure class names or element structures haven't changed

### Date Parsing Issues

- Verify the Time Format matches your timestamp format
- Check that Timestamp XPath extracts the date string correctly
- Common formats: RFC3339, ISO 8601, or custom formats

## Advanced Usage

### Complex Content Extraction

For sites with complex content structures, you can use more advanced XPath:

```xpath
.//div[contains(@class, "content")]//p[not(contains(@class, "ads"))]/text()
```

This selects text from paragraphs within content divs, excluding ad paragraphs.

### Multiple Categories

To extract multiple categories/tags:

```xpath
.//span[contains(@class, "tag")]/text()
```

This will collect all tag texts within each article.
